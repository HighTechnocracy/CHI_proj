<i>Mapping the data from the CHI statewide workbooks</i>

###BACKGROUND
In June 2015, the Colorado Health Institute (http://www.coloradohealthinstitute.org) released an Excel document with several tabs, 64 tabs with data for each county in Colorado, one for the state, one with data sources, and an introductory sheet. The 65 sheets with county-level data and the one with state-level data recorded 43 variables from various sources. The idea was that these variables would help researchers and local public health officials spot "holes" in the delivery of healthcare across the state.

I found this data important and valuable but also difficult to use. I thought the data would be better if it was (1) all on one sheet so that comparisons could be made more readily and (2) able to be visualized, especially in map form.

###PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to create a Shiny app that will allow researchers and public health officials to usefully visualize the data stored in the CHI worksheets. For the purposes of this course, I have chosen to create a Shiny app that allows the user to input two of the 43 CHI variables to more readily spot specific holes. For example, the user could display the number of nurse practitioners into the upper map and the number who have visited hospital emergency departments. The discrepancies in certain counties should stand out.

###VARIABLES
The following 43 variables are potential options for visualization. The second column below lists CHI's data sources.
Total population										Colorado Demography OfficePersons per square mile								Colorado Demography OfficeUnder 18 											Colorado Demography OfficeWorking age adults (19-64)							Colorado Demography OfficeFemales of child bearing age (15-44)						Colorado Demography Office65 and older										Colorado Demography OfficeTotal projected population 								Colorado Demography OfficeProjected Under 18 									Colorado Demography OfficeProjected Working age adults (19-64)					Colorado Demography OfficeProjected Females of child bearing age (15-44)				Colorado Demography OfficeProjected65 and older								Colorado Demography OfficeMedian household income 							American Community SurveyPopulation at or below the federal poverty line				American Community SurveyCommercially insured residents							American Community SurveyPublicly insured residents

All variables are given at the county level, except for the final three (percentages of those that visited emergency departments, healthcare facilities, and dentists). Those are given by health region.
